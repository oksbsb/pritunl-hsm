go-ykpiv
========

go-ykpiv is a high level cgo wrapper around `libykpiv.so.1` that implements an
idiomatic go API fit for use when applications need to communicate with a
Yubikey in PIV mode.

What's PIV?
-----------

PIV Cards are cards defined by FIPS 201, a Federal US Government standard
defining the ID cards employees use. At its core, it's a set of x509
Certificates and corresponding private keys in a configuration that is
standardized across implementations.

For more details on how PIV Tokens can be used, the FICAM
(Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management) team at GSA
(General Services Administration) has published some guides on GitHub
under [GSA/piv-guides](https://github.com/GSA/piv-guides)

How is this different than OpenSC?
----------------------------------

Most PIV tokens, Yubikeys included, can be used as a PKCS#11 device using
[OpenSC](https://github.com/opensc/opensc), and Yubikeys are even capable of doing
Signing and Decryption through that interface. However, some management functions
are not exposed in the PKCS#11 OpenSC interface, so this library may be of use
when one wants to write a new Certificate, or set PINs.

Development
===========

Testing
-------

To run the tests, you'll need to find a Yubikey that you're willing to wipe
clean, and destroy all data on it. After you've found such a key, remove all
other Yubikeys from your machine.

The tests will panic if the `YKPIV_YES_DESTROY_MY_KEY` environment variable
is unset.

Running the tests will **reset** your Yubikey a few times (once per test), and
you will wind up with a key with the default PIN, PUK and Management Key.

Installation
============

Debian
------

```

Examples
========

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/pritunl/pritunl-hsm/ykpiv"
)

func main() {
	yubikey, err := ykpiv.New(ykpiv.Options{
		// Verbose: true,
		Reader: "Yubico Yubikey NEO U2F+CCID 01 00",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer yubikey.Close()

	version, err := yubikey.Version()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Application version %s found.\n", version)
}
